                    My Altschool journey will be 12 months long and I would be working towards learning and connecting with peers in the school. I also would be working towards being available for classes and doing assignments when given/demanded, to be here throughout this journey and graduate when I'm due

                    I signed up for Altschool because i wanted to learn coding remotely, i have always wanted to code and build stuffs and Altschool seems favorable seeing how much dedication the founders and staffs are putting into nurturing world class software engineers. While also learning how to code, I'd also learn how to work with a team and also connect with other software engineers and students in Altschool

                    I am open to learning new things. I am fascinated by tech and learning to explore so much we could build to solve human problems. I love art and nature, in all forms it exists, it's soothes m spirit. I have worked as a Waiter in different hospitality industry. Currently, I'm learning DeFi and learning about protocols and chains building in the eco system
